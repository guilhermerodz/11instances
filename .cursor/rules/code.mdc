Code quality:
- When implementing a solution, prefer writing the simplest syntax and logistics, even if it would take slightly more lines of code when compared to an over-engineered super-advanced nerdy approach. In other words â€“ if a potential solution end being optimized, advanced and fast, keep these qualities while still breaking the code into well-defined separation of concerns. Keep it simple and elegant.
