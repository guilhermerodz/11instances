globs: *.ts, *.tsx

JavaScript/TypeScript:
- General imports:
  - The imports are always at the top of the file.
  - The import groups are separated by a blank line.
  - 1st group: the third-party-library imports (example: "react", "next", "zustand", "motion").
  - 2nd group: the path mappings imports, such as "@/components/button".
  - 3rd group: the relative locals imports, such as "../file-name.tsx".

TypeScript specific:
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.
